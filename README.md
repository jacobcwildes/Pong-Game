# Pong-Game

A Verilog-based Pong game designed by Dyllon Dunton and myself (Jacob Wildes). It features a basic Pong game, where two players share a keyboard.
The left player controls their paddle with the W and S key, and the right player controls their paddle with UP and DOWN. 
The ball shifts color from red to blue as it moves across the screen.
Once one of the scores reaches 10, the game ends.
